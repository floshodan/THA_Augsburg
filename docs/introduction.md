# Introduction

Welcome to the THA Augsburg project documentation! This project represents a modern approach to building intelligent web applications by combining the power of Next.js, n8n workflow automation, and OpenAI's language models.

## Project Overview

THA Augsburg is a sophisticated web application that leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide intelligent task handling and automation. The project combines a modern frontend built with Next.js and React with a powerful backend powered by n8n workflow automation and OpenAI's language models.

## Architecture

The project follows a modern architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Frontend Layer
- Built with Next.js 15 and React 19
- TypeScript for type safety
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Backend Layer
- n8n for workflow automation
- OpenAI integration for intelligent processing
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation
- Custom API endpoints for data handling

### AI Integration
- OpenAI's language models for natural language processing
- RAG system for enhanced response generation
- Intelligent task routing and processing

## Key Features

- **Modern Frontend**: Fast, responsive, and user-friendly interface
- **Workflow Automation**: Powerful n8n integration for complex workflows
- **AI Capabilities**: Advanced language processing with OpenAI
- **RAG Implementation**: Enhanced AI responses with contextual information
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
- **State Management**: Efficient state handling with Zustand
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
