# AI Agents System

The AI agents system in THA Augsburg is designed to provide intelligent, context-aware assistance to students learning to code. Each agent has specific responsibilities and works in concert with others to deliver comprehensive support.

## Agent Architecture

### 1. Code Analysis Agent

The Code Analysis Agent is responsible for examining and understanding student code submissions.

#### Capabilities
- Syntax error detection and explanation
- Logical error identification
- Code style analysis
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Security vulnerability detection

#### Implementation Details
- Uses OpenAI's Codex model for code understanding
- Implements custom parsing for specific programming languages
- Maintains a knowledge base of common errors and solutions
- Provides context-aware error explanations

### 2. Learning Progress Agent

The Learning Progress Agent tracks and analyzes student development over time.

#### Capabilities
- Progress tracking and visualization
- Learning pattern recognition
- Difficulty level adjustment
- Personalized learning path generation
- Performance analytics

#### Implementation Details
- Machine learning models for progress prediction
- Statistical analysis of success rates
- Pattern recognition in error types
- Adaptive difficulty scaling
- Progress visualization generation

### 3. Context Agent

The Context Agent maintains the learning session context and ensures consistent assistance.

#### Capabilities
- Session history tracking
- Context-aware help generation
- Example code suggestion
- Related concept linking
- Learning resource recommendation

#### Implementation Details
- Vector database for context storage
- Semantic search for relevant examples
- Knowledge graph for concept relationships
- Context window management
- Resource relevance scoring

## Agent Collaboration

### Communication Protocol
- Message passing between agents
- Shared context management
- Priority-based task handling
- Conflict resolution mechanisms

### Decision Making
- Consensus-based decisions
- Priority weighting system
- Fallback strategies
- Confidence scoring

## Integration with n8n

### Workflow Integration
- Agent activation triggers
- Response assembly
- Error handling
- State management

### Data Flow
1. Frontend request received
2. n8n workflow initiated
3. Relevant agents activated
4. Responses collected and processed
5. Final response assembled
6. Feedback delivered to frontend

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
- Agent response caching
- Context caching
- Example code caching
- Analysis result caching

### Resource Management
- Agent load balancing
- Request queuing
- Priority-based processing
- Resource allocation optimization

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Agent availability monitoring
- Response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Resource usage tracking

### Updates and Improvements
- Continuous learning from interactions
- Model fine-tuning
- Knowledge base updates
- Performance optimization
