# n8n Workflow Implementation

n8n serves as the backbone of THA Augsburg's automation system, orchestrating the interaction between the frontend, AI agents, and data storage systems.

## Workflow Overview

![n8n Workflow Diagram](../images/n8n-workflow.png)

The diagram above shows our main n8n workflows:
- Test workflow with Pinecone Vector Store integration
- AI Agent workflow with OpenAI integration and Vector Store Tool
- Webhook handling and response generation

## Core Workflows

### 1. Code Submission Workflow

#### Trigger
- Webhook from frontend
- Code submission event

#### Process
1. Validate submission format
2. Route to appropriate AI agents
3. Collect and process responses
4. Generate feedback
5. Update student profile

#### Error Handling
- Invalid submission format
- AI service unavailability
- Timeout handling
- Retry mechanisms

### 2. Learning Progress Workflow

#### Trigger
- Scheduled execution
- Significant progress events

#### Process
1. Collect recent activity data
2. Analyze progress patterns
3. Update learning path
4. Generate progress report
5. Notify relevant parties

#### Analytics
- Success rate tracking
- Time spent analysis
- Error pattern recognition
- Difficulty level assessment

### 3. Context Management Workflow

#### Trigger
- New learning session
- Context update events

#### Process
1. Initialize session context
2. Load relevant history
3. Update knowledge base
4. Prepare resources
5. Maintain session state

#### State Management
- Session persistence
- Context window management
- Resource tracking
- State synchronization
