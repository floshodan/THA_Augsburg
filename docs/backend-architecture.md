# Backend Architecture

The backend of THA Augsburg is built around a powerful combination of n8n workflow automation and AI agents, creating an intelligent and responsive system for code learning assistance.

## Core Components

### n8n Workflow Engine
- Serves as the central orchestration layer
- Manages the flow of data between different system components
- Handles webhook triggers from the frontend
- Coordinates AI agent interactions
- Manages state and persistence

### AI Agent System
The system employs multiple specialized AI agents:

1. **Code Analysis Agent**
   - Analyzes student code submissions
   - Identifies syntax errors and logical issues
   - Provides detailed error explanations
   - Suggests potential fixes

2. **Learning Progress Agent**
   - Tracks student progress over time
   - Identifies patterns in common mistakes
   - Suggests personalized learning paths
   - Generates progress reports

3. **Context Agent**
   - Maintains context of current learning session
   - Tracks previous interactions
   - Provides relevant examples and references
   - Ensures consistent assistance

## Workflow Process

1. **Code Submission**
   - Student submits code through frontend
   - Webhook triggers n8n workflow
   - Code is processed by AI agents

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Code Analysis Agent examines submission
   - Learning Progress Agent updates student profile
   - Context Agent provides relevant context

3. **Response Generation**
   - AI agents collaborate to generate feedback
   - n8n orchestrates the response assembly
   - Feedback is sent back to frontend

4. **Learning Adaptation**
   - System updates student profile
   - Adjusts difficulty and suggestions
   - Prepares for next interaction

## Integration Points

### Frontend Communication
- RESTful API endpoints
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Webhook endpoints for asynchronous processing

### AI Services
- OpenAI API integration
- Custom model fine-tuning
- Vector database for context storage

### Data Storage
- Student progress tracking
- Code submission history
- Learning analytics
- System configuration

## Error Handling

- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- Fallback mechanisms for common scenarios
- Logging and monitoring for system health
- Automatic recovery procedures

## Performance Considerations

- Caching frequently accessed data
- Batch processing for analytics
- Load balancing for AI requests
- Optimized database queries
